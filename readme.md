## Overview
This project is a beginner-friendly tool that determines whether a given input string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., "madam," "racecar").

## How It Works
1. User enters a string into the input field.
2. On clicking the "Check" button, the string is reversed and compared with the original string.
3. An alert box displays whether the input is a palindrome or not.

## Features
- Real-time palindrome checking.
- Lightweight and fast execution.
- Simple and intuitive UI.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- JavaScript

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

### Steps to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Geekykiran/Palindrome-checker.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd palindrome-checker
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the application.

## Usage
1. Type a word or phrase in the input box.
2. Click the "Check" button.
3. Observe the result displayed via an alert box.

### Example Inputs and Results:
- Input: `madam`  
  Output: "P A L I N D R O M E !!"
- Input: `hello`  
  Output: "Not a Palindrome!"

## Future Enhancements
- Add styling using CSS for better user experience.
- Allow case-insensitive palindrome checking.
- Ignore spaces and special characters in input.
- Display results on the page instead of using alert boxes.
- Enhance accessibility for users with disabilities.
